description: "The standing rules of a `uv` workspace monorepo: one lockfile and one venv for every member, `uv sync --all-packages` as what makes a cross-member import resolve, `uv run` from the root rather than a per-package venv, and a README per member that is the thing to read before changing that member. Generic to any uv workspace; the member list belongs in the repo's own policy."

## This is a `uv` workspace monorepo

One `uv.lock` and one venv at the root serve every member. A member is not a
separate environment to activate — it is a package in the same resolution.

```bash
uv sync --all-packages   # every member importable
uv run <cmd>             # from the ROOT, against that one venv
```

`--all-packages` is load-bearing, not thoroughness. A bare `uv sync` (and the
implicit sync a bare `uv run` performs) resolves **this root and its dev group
only** — every other member is absent, and code that imports one dies with
`ModuleNotFoundError` on a machine where nothing is wrong. That failure reads as
a broken import, which is why it costs an afternoon.

Python ≥ {{ template.python_floor | default("3.12") }}.

- **A member's dependency belongs in that member's `pyproject.toml`**, not the
  root's. The root pins the workspace and the dev tooling; a dependency added
  there is invisible to the package that actually needs it the moment that
  package is installed on its own.
- **Every member has a README, and it is the thing to read before changing that
  member** — before its source, and instead of hunting for a per-package
  instruction file. Assume no member carries a nested `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`
  — one that does is the exception, and it is there in the directory to be seen.
- **Run tools from the root**, so one pass covers every member. A lint or a type
  check run inside a single package sees a subset of the code and a subset of
  the config.
